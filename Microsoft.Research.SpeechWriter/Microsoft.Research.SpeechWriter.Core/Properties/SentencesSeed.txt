OH YOU WICKED LITTLE THING
REALLY DINAH OUGHT TO HAVE TAUGHT YOU BETTER MANNERS
YOU OUGHT DINAH YOU KNOW YOU OUGHT
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO MORROW IS KITTY
YOU'D HAVE GUESSED IF YOU'D BEEN UP IN THE WINDOW WITH ME ONLY DINAH WAS MAKING YOU TIDY SO YOU COULDN'T
I WAS WATCHING THE BOYS GETTING IN STICKS FOR THE BONFIRE AND IT WANTS PLENTY OF STICKS KITTY
ONLY IT GOT SO COLD AND IT SNOWED SO THEY HAD TO LEAVE OFF
WE'LL GO AND SEE THE BONFIRE TOMORROW
DO YOU KNOW I WAS SO ANGRY WHEN I SAW ALL THE MISCHIEF YOU HAD BEEN DOING I WAS VERY NEARLY OPENING THE WINDOW AND PUTTING YOU OUT INTO THE SNOW
AND YOU'D HAVE DESERVED IT
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY FOR YOURSELF
NOW DON'T INTERRUPT ME
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ALL YOUR FAULTS
NUMBER ONE YOU SQUEAKED TWICE WHILE DINAH WAS WASHING YOUR FACE THIS MORNING
NOW YOU CAN'T DENY IT I HEARD YOU
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY
HER PAW WENT INTO YOUR EYE
WELL THAT'S YOUR FAULT FOR KEEPING YOUR EYES OPEN IF YOU'D SHUT THEM TIGHT UP IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
NOW DON'T MAKE ANY MORE EXCUSES
NUMBER TWO YOU PULLED SNOWDROP AWAY BY THE TAIL JUST AS I HAD PUT DOWN THE SAUCER OF MILK BEFORE HER
WHAT YOU WERE THIRSTY WERE YOU
HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE WASN'T THIRSTY TOO
NOW FOR NUMBER THREE YOU UNWOUND EVERY BIT OF THE WORSTED WHILE I WASN'T LOOKING
THAT'S THREE FAULTS KITTY AND YOU'VE NOT BEEN PUNISHED FOR ANY OF THEM YET
YOU KNOW I'M SAVING UP ALL YOUR PUNISHMENTS FOR NEXT WEDNESDAY
SUPPOSE THEY HAD SAVED UP ALL MY PUNISHMENTS
WHAT WOULD THEY DO AT THE END OF A YEAR
I SHOULD BE SENT TO PRISON I SUPPOSE WHEN THE DAY CAME
OR LET ME SEE SUPPOSE EACH PUNISHMENT WAS TO BE GOING WITHOUT A DINNER THEN WHEN THE MISERABLE DAY CAME I SHOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT FIFTY DINNERS AT ONCE
WELL I SHOULDN'T MIND THAT
I'D FAR RATHER GO WITHOUT THEM THAN EAT THEM
